NovEmBER, 1899. |

stone steps led from terrace to terrace. As heset his foot
upon the middle one of the third flight he felt it quiver be-
neath him. ‘‘Is this made ground?” he asked, a little
anxiously. . Marcella laughed back: ‘‘ Yes! the Lord made it
—with a very little help from my grandpa. This hillside was
in what we country folks call benches—he flattened the
benches a little, filled in a few places, and turfed over the
slopes, so they should not wash. At least, he began to do it—
Uncle-Major has followed the pattern set him. We are mighty
proud of our orchards—also of the fact that the Hawk’s Nest
is a brand that always fetches the top of the market. Yousee
nobody can quite touch us in quality, because nobody has got
just such another hillside. See! It spreads in a big half moon.
There are seventy-five acres planted. We need not go higher.
The early peaches, there at the top, went to market three
months back. Look down and along these rows, though, and
tell me if New York can show anything more beautiful?”
“If it can, I have not seen it,’ Archer said, letting his eyes
shift quickly and covertly from the laden trees to her face.
Yet the trees were worth anybody’s looking at. Through the
deep green of healthy leaves, still rich and oily of surface in
spite of the rain, there gleamed pinkish rounds, and faintly
yellow ovals, and clustered knops of deep, glowing scarlet.
The boughs bent heavily earthward. Their tips were mud-
spattered, yet scarcely one was broken. Along the curving
edge of each terrace grape vines stood in double rank, one in-
side, one outside a long wire trellis. Now the trellis was a

_ wall of green stems and leaves and purple and tawny clusters.
“Bélow were the pear trees, laden with green and russet, and

lowest of all a solid terrace of grapes. The fine essence of
growth and ripeness hung and hovered in the mist that rose
and curled about in defiance of the splashing rain.

“T am in love—with all I have seen here,” Archer went on.
“It isa new world to me. It must be I have a sort of in-
herited aptness for it. I can never be grateful enough to
Fate—and the storm.”

“T love the rain so much it had to be good to me,” Mar-
cella said, saucily. ‘‘Only think how I should have got
through this without you! ‘You see how things go—it is
whist, whist from breakfast to bedtime. And I hate whist,

even if five could play. If you had not been here to entertain

me I might have been forced to come up here and play scare-
crow all day and every day.”

“To escape—what, ennui or Mr. Blight?” Archer asked,
laughing. Marcella looked at him severely. ‘‘I hate tautol-
ogy,” she said.

“You surely cannot mean that ennui and Blight are syn-
onyms?” Archer said. ‘‘Consider, my dear young lady! He
has confided to me that he will one day have a quarter of a
million—if only he marries to please his mother.”

“What does that signify to me? I don’t please her,” Mar-
cella answered, affecting to put her hand to her eyes. “Such
good things of this world are clearly not for me. I’m pre-
destined to take root here, like one of these trees—and live
till I die.”

“T don’t believe any of them die,” Archer protested. Mar-
cella looked pensive. ‘‘I hate to admit it,” she said, ‘‘but you
are nearly right. There is just one tree that dies. It has been
planted over and over. I mean trees of all sorts have been set
in one particular place, and they always die after a year or
two, though there seems to be nothing the matter. I wonder
if ” she checked herself suddenly and flushed deeply. The
thought had shot through her mind that this fated spot was
perhaps the one from which her uncle’s gold had been stolen.

‘‘T have a story to tell Major Clayton. Will you come to-
night and listen to it?” Archer asked, as they set their faces
houseward. Marcella nodded. ‘‘If the rest are not to hear,”
she said. ‘‘One can endure even a bad story, if it is only
exclusive.”

HE. DESIGNER, 9%

“Mr. Blight, at least, will not be there,” Archer said, his
eyes twinkling. Marcella laughed tranquilly. ‘‘If you break
up the rubber he is sure to propose to Sweet Alyssum,” she
said. ‘‘Oh, she is worlds too good for him, but she likes his
mother and his expectations. I gave Uncle-Major a hint this
morning—that is, I suppose, the reason he has time to listen
to you.”

All day the storm strengthened. It raged and roared its
wildest toward nine o’clock that night, as Major Clayton sat
with Marcella at his elbow, listening to his young guest. ‘All
I shall say of my family,” young Archer began, ‘‘is that my
mother is Southern too—she was one of the Baltimore Teackles.
I was born, indeed, in Baltimore, but all my memories are of
life in New York. You know my father, sir. I don't need to
tell you what he is—the bravest, truest, honestest gentleman,
modest and faithful. The wonder to me is that he has made
a living in that big town. Of course he has never made a
fortune. He’s in a bank there—not high up in it, but where
he gets decent pay. He aimed to give mea college training.
When I was twelve mother had a long, long illness. She had
to go away for a year, or die. I heard the Governor tell her
so. She looked at him with the sweetest smile, and shook her
head, saying, ‘It would take all we have been saving for our
boy’s education.’ I—but never mind! She went and came
back well.. Then I said to the Governor, ‘I’m going in busi-
ness, sir —didn’t ask, just told him. He looked a little
troubled, but when he found I was office boy for a big, clean-
dealing firm, he patted my head, and said he’d help me nights
with my books.

‘I studied them pretty hard, but the firm and their interests
harder. Not to tire you, when I was twenty-one they offered
me a junior partnership. That was five years back. I didn’t
take it—preferred to go on the street for myself. My old
firm offered me money—any reasonable amount, but I was
cautious, tremendously cautious, until, when I took a risk, I
could feel I was risking only my own. That kept me out of
big deals until just this year. I jumped in early for all I was
worth—every cent—on copper, and the market came my way.
A month back I figured my profits, and found I could keep
my original stake yet take out fifty thousand dollars. I have
been finding out, too, all I could about the Governor. Mother
let me know the truth—he had the old Southern land-hunger.
It was the grief of his life that he had had to part with the
family plantation. That was why he had not talked about it
—it hurt too bad.

“Then I found out, also, by the luckiest chance, that Gray-
rock, his old home, could be bought back. It was bought back
in a wink—but the Governor does not know it yet. I was on
my way there when the water stopped me. From the county
town I telegraphed him, ‘I am here and need you. Come at
once. Bring mother.’ They will get here to-morrow at the
latest. I must meet them, rain or shine. I mean to establish
them here, to put the rest of that fifty thousand in trust for
them—then——”

He broke off short, his voice for the first time losing its
sharp evenness. After a second’s pause he went on: “ Then
I said to myself, I will go back to the street, and play for all
that is in the game. Now I—well! The whole world has
changed since I—since I met—Marcella. I want her for my
wife, Major, much more than I want a fortune.” )

Marcella’s eyes answered him. With a laugh that was hal
a sob he caught her in hisarms. Major Clayton got up and
took the girl from his hold, saying: ‘‘If you please, Mr.
Archer, we will consider that—that you have not spoken,
until you see and consult with your father.”

A minute later he was alone listening to the storm’s fury
without in the Jeast heeding it, so deeply was he wrapped in
rumination. He thought he understood everything now.
Archer had not meant to steal—he had taken the hidden
